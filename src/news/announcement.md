Since 2012, Johnny-Five has relied on a [Github repo](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five) to be its "home" on the web. Today we're excited to welcome the JavaScript and Maker community to our new site!

Just like [Johnny-Five](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five) itself, [Johnny-Five.org](http://johnny-five.org/) is an open source project; this means that community contributions towards improvement are _always_ welcome! Have a look around the site and [let us know what works and what doesn't](https://github.com/Bocoup/johnny-five.org)!
