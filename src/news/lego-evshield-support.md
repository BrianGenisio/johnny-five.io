After several months of development and testing, we're pleased to announce preliminary support for [mindsensors.com's EVShield](http://www.mindsensors.com/arduino/16-evshield-for-arduino-duemilanove-or-uno). This means that you can now program Lego Mindstorm robotics projects with JavaScript, using Johnny-Five! 

Check out the examples here:
